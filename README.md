## 📁 What’s Inside

### 🧭 Workshop Walkthrough  
A **Workshop Walkthrough** directory contains a subfolder for each step of the coding process. Follow them in order to reproduce the full workflow demonstrated during the session.

### 📥 Test LAR File  
A **UsersAndPage.lar** file with default data is available for you to import into the portal. Use it to verify that your Export/Import functionality behaves as expected.

### 📦 Preconfigured Bundles  
A set of **bundles with all workshop changes already deployed** is ready for you. Simply [download it here](https://github.com/Hant-Eldeen1/liferay-headless-devcon-2025/releases), update the `liferay.home` property inside `portal-ext.properties` to point to your bundle path, and run the application.
